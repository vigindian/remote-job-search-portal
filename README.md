## 5. Apache WSGI Setup
In a production environment, it is recommended to run a flask application via Apache or a similar application:
- Install and configure apache.
- Install the Apache WSGI module.
- [apache_flaskapp.conf.sample](apache_flaskapp.conf.sample): sample apache wsgi config to run this flask-app.
- This app uses a test user to show the authenticated user in app UI. You can get Apache to pass the REMOTE_USER variable to the app, which can be shown in the UI.
- All the 'print' messages in the app will go to Apache logs.

## Roadmap
- Delete jobs older than 60 days.
- Cleanup jobs if deleted from source site(s).
- Email and/or RSS Subscription.
